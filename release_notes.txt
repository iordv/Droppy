# Droppy v4.4.0

## Improvements
- **Redesigned Update Window**: Now matches Settings window styling with proper title bar, compact size, and refined layout
- **Performance Optimizations**: Removed CPU-intensive HexagonDotsEffect and hover scale animations from multiple views
- **Window Drag Fixes**: Fixed issue where dragging buttons or clipboard entries would move the entire window

## Fixes
- **Clipboard Drag Behavior**: Dragging clipboard entries now only drags out the content as a file, no longer moves window
- **Settings/Update Window Buttons**: Buttons no longer trigger window drag when clicked and dragged
