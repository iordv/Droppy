## Droppy 4.3.1 — Stability Hotfix

### 🐛 Critical Fixes
- **Fixed crash on scroll**: Replaced WebKit-based GIF previews with native NSImageView (no more objc_release crash)
- **Menu bar icon sizing**: Adjusted to 20pt for better compatibility across M1 and M4 devices
- **HUD animations**: Volume/brightness now shrink with the notch like the media player

### 🎨 Visual Improvements
- Removed white borders from Settings GIF previews for cleaner look
- Reduced GIF preview height for less vertical space
